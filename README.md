# ðŸ§  Monopoly Strategy Simulator

This project simulates 1,000+ games of Monopoly to compare player strategies (Aggressive, Conservative, Random). I used Django to store the results, a simple API to expose them, and React to display the insights. I also used Python and matplotlib to generate graphs.
